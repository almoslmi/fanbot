# FanBot

A twitter bot to compliment people and make them feel happy.

## Features

 - Randomly tweets a random compliment from compliments.txt at your target
 - Can be asked for an immediate compliment
 - Includes lock.py for autorestarting upon server restart

## Future Features

 - Posse mode?  Retweet with hype!
 - Learns from target's tweets?
 - Target can tell bot how frequently to post?
 - Console mode for debugging?
 - Command line arg for printing tweets instead of tweeting to API for debugging.
 - Quick install tool?  I'm not sure if the install process is too long or not.

## Installation and Operation

Installation should go pretty quickly.

 1. Clone this repository - `git clone https://github.com/rpalo/fanbot.git && cd fanbot`
 2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment for the application - `python3 -m venv .venv`  If you name it `.venv`, the .gitignore file will ignore it by default.
 3. (Required only if you did step 2) Activate your virtual environment
  - Windows PowerShell: `.venv/scripts/activate`
  - *nix: `source .venv/bin/activate`
 4. Install the required packages - `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
 5. Create your secrets file - `mv fanbot/secrets.sample.py fanbot/secrets.py`
 6. Create a twitter account for your bot.
 7. *While logged in as this bot,* create a [twitter app](https://apps.twitter.com) for your bot.
 8. From the "Keys and Access Tokens" tab of your new app, create a new key.
 9. Take note of your Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token, and Access Token Secret.
 10. Fill these values into your `secrets.py` file.  Also fill in the username of the account you wish to be a fan of.
 11. Fill out the `main.py` file with instructions of your own.  Take note of Twitter's [rate limiting policy.](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting)  See the [schedule module documentation](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/schedule) for more info.
 12. Run the tests to make sure everything's working right.  In the main folder, simply type `pytest`.  (As is evident, this uses Pytest.  If you prefer `nose` or another testing tool, you might have to do some tweedling before you can test.  Or maybe not.  Not sure.)
 13. Let 'er rip!  `python3 main.py`
 13. (Optional) Set up your bot [as a service](#Setting-Up-as-a-Service) so it will run on a remote server and have output logs and you can leave it alone the "right way".

## Setting Up as a Service

Included in the main folder is a file `fanbot.service`.  You'll need to edit this folder to include the **absolute** path to your python executable and your `main.py` file.  You can also include any command-line arguments.  To run the service from inside your virtual environment, simply point the python executable to the one in your .venv folder (i.e. /home/{{ you }}/fanbot/.venv/bin/python).  Then it will work as expected.

## Autorestarting

In order to to auto restarting, run the script with the `--lock` option.
`python3 main.py --lock`)
Then setup a cron job (or whatever other task scheduler you prefer) periodically run `lock.py`.  The `--lock` option binds a lock socket.  `lock.py` will check if that socket is still bound.  If so, it doesn't do anything else.  If the socket is available, it means the server restarted and the fanbot is no longer running and needs restarted.

## Customization

If you've gotten this far, hopefully you are comfortable editing files etc.  All of the randomized compliments are kept in [compliments.py](https://github.com/rpalo/fanbot/blob/master/fanbot/compliments.py).  You can modify the start-up/shut-down messages in [fanbot.py](https://github.com/rpalo/fanbot/blob/master/fanbot/fanbot.py).  Please please please don't check your actual [secrets.py](https://github.com/rpalo/fanbot/blob/master/fanbot/secrets.sample.py) into your repository without encryption.

## Contributions

I've never really had anybody contribute to any of my projects before, but I'm super open to it.  I would almost say it might be a good idea to lay out a rough skeleton of your changes and open the pull request up front so we can talk about it before you do a bunch of work.  

## Code of Conduct

I don't think I'll need this, but it can't hurt.  Obviously the code of conduct comes down to the "Don't Be a Fartknuckle" Systemâ„¢.  To get a good feel for what it means to Not Be a Fartknuckle, check out the [Ubuntu Code of Conduct](https://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/conduct).  If you have any problems, don't hesitate to let me know.  If I give you problems, ditto, but additionally make sure you call me a Fartknuckle.
